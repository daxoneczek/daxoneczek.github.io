        <span id="nazwa">China</span> (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the <span id="nazwa2">People's Republic of China (PRC; Chinese: 中华人民共和国</span>; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó), is a country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of more than 1.4 billion people. China spans five geographical time zones and borders 14 countries, the second most of any country in the world after Russia. Covering an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third or fourth largest country.[i] The country consists of 23 provinces,[j] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau).

        This past spring, I had the opportunity to visit China for a two-week vacation. My wife and I joined some of our friends on a group tour that was organized by a Chinese travel company.
        
        It is no exaggeration to say that this was a trip of a lifetime. Six years in the planning, the journey covered 1,000 miles through seven cities, starting in Beijing and ending in Hong Kong. We traveled by bus, bullet train, boat, and airplane, and we stayed in some of the finest hotels the country has to offer. We saw some truly amazing sites, and I learned quite a bit about Chinese history and culture from our guides.
        
        I took notes along the way so I could report on what I saw and experienced. Overall, it was an incredible vacation—even if it was also exhausting.</p>
